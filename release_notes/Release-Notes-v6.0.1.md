This was a patch release built on top of Release 6.0.0, adding support for extra devices on EMU.

Changes:

- Patches to ITC503 to support EMU's response format
- Put KEPCO in remote mode automatically when setting values
- Add support for CAEN v895
- Zero field controller: don't report overloaded when in manual

IBEX GUI and genie python are the same as [6.0.0](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/wiki/Release-Notes-v6.0.0)
